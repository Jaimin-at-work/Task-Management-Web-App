🗂️ Task Management System Web Application
📌 Overview
The Task Management System Web Application is a full-stack project designed to streamline the process of creating, assigning, tracking, and managing tasks within a team or organization. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), the system emphasizes real-time updates, role-based access, and collaborative task management.

🚀 Features
Task Lifecycle Management: Create, read, update, and delete tasks with status indicators like To-Do, In Progress, and Completed.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define permissions for Admins, Managers, and Team Members.

Real-Time Dashboard: Instantly reflects task updates using Redux Toolkit and React state management.

Secure Authentication: JWT-based authentication ensures user session integrity.

User Collaboration: Task comments and progress logs promote team communication.

Responsive UI: Optimized for desktop and mobile using Tailwind CSS.
